# Quickcache

## About

This is a completely unremarkable package that I use for various projects, and have edited as needed, depending on package requirements.

Unit testing is included to ensure that everything is working ðŸ’¯ correctly.

There is another package named quickcache at https://github.com/qieguo2016/quickcache - but this package is not related to that repo.

## Motivation

Similar caching packages were either not actively maintained, or were bringing a sledgehammer to solve a problem that needed a simple hammer.

## Documentation

Inline documentation may be satisfactory for using the package.
